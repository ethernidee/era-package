In the fifth version about 60% of code was rewritten, a few non critical bugs dealing with game mechanics were fixed. Yona is quite tolerant to other mods, passively and first adds hints in battle log dialog, does not activate special ability on ESC if cursor is blocked via ERM (mostly, cursor is locked when emulation of new abilities or spells is implemented in custom mod).

 Now three files with the following contents are responsible for configuration:

creature descriptions.txt
 0="Anti-cavalry: 200%. Ignores cavalry bonus";
 1="Anti-cavalry: 200%. Ignores cavalry bonus";
 2="Aimed shot: 300%";
 3="Aimed shot: 300%. Shoots twice";
 6="Block: 50%";
 7="Block: 50%. Strikes twice";
 10="Cavalry: +20% dmg per hex";
 11="Cavalry: +20% dmg per hex";
 88="Damage depends on distance";
 89="Damage depends on distance";

 It allows to assign any description to any creature by its id.

 The number of options was severely reduced, because their previous quantity used to increase efforts for adding anything new.

 The feature of this release is "aimed shot" ability. It's activated by archers and marksmen on their turn by pressing ESC key (all checks for permission of this activation at current moment present). New ability support network gaming too. Stack choses a hex to aim at. Damage for this particular hex will be tripled in the next turn, if the possibility and willing to attack remain. The ability uses two cursors (thanks to Valery, cursors are replaced on the fly using redirection mechanism) and sound of activation.

 AI is currently absent, but planned.
