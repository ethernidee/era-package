Mapmaker Tools  August 16, 2004

This document describes tools and techniques that may be useful to custom WoG mapmakers
and ERM script writers:

  1. Auto-Loading a Customized Set of WoG Options for your Map.
  2. Creating and Including Custom Hero Portraits in your WoG Map.
  3. Enabling the Built-in Cheat Menu.
  4. Using the Built-in Cheat Codes.
  5. Enabling the WoG "Cheat" Menu, for Map and Script Testing.


Auto-Loading a Customized Set of WOG Options for your Map
---------------------------------------------------------
Now, with WoG 3.58 it's easier than ever to include a custom selection of WoGify scripts
and options in a map--and it doesn't even require copying and pasting!

Just follow these simple instructions:

 a) Open the WoG Options menu and select the options you wish to use.
 b) Save the file to the Maps folder with a custom file name. It's generally simplest to
    use a name similar to your map name. So if your map is named "Conquer the World.h3m",
    you might call this "Conquer the World.dat".
 c) Create a timed event in your map (you can name it anything).
 d) Set the event so it won't trigger for any players and set the event day to 600.
 e) In the event body, put the following (assuming you used "Conquer the World.dat"):

    ZVSE
    !#UN:J3/^maps\Conquer the World.dat^;

 f) Click OK to save the event.
 g) Save your map.
 h) When you zip your map to email to someone (or to upload to a web site), be sure to
    include your custom wog options file too (e.g., Conquer the World.dat).

Now whenever anyone plays the map it will automatically load your customized WoGify Options
file and will use those options for your map instead of whatever options the player normally
plays with.

Creating and Including Custom Hero Portraits in your WoG Map
------------------------------------------------------------
Even if you aren't an ERM script writer, you may wish to include custom hero portraits in
your WoG map. The following are some simple instructions for doing so.

 a) First you need to create a large and small portrait of the correct size and graphic type.

  A portrait consists of two differently-sized graphics files in PCX format (256 colours only)
so you will need a graphics program capable of exporting files in this format. One file is
used for the larger portrait picture, and the other for the smaller one (such as the one that
appears in the list of heroes opposite the list of towns on the main display).

  The large file must be 58x64 (58 pixels wide and 64 pixels high).
  The small file must be 48x32 (48 pixels wide and 32 pixels high).

  Both files should have names that are a maximum of 8 characters long plus the extension.

  Place both files in your Heroes3\Data folder and zip them together with your map before
  sharing it with other WoG players or sending it to a web site. Make sure you include a note
  telling players to copy the files to the Data folder! (You may even wish to put a reminder
  into a Day 1 Event in the map so that nobody accidentally misses it.)

  For this example, we'll name the large file "sylvia.pcx" and the small file "sylvia-s.pcx"

 b) Create a timed event in your map (you can name it anything).
 c) Set the event so it won't trigger for any players and set the event day to 600.
 d) Look up the Internal Hero Number of the hero whose portrait you'll be customizing.
    There's a list called "Format H" in the ERM Help. Hero numbers go from 0 through 155.
    For this example, we'll use Sylvia, whose hero number is 3. This number goes immediately
    after the !#HE command and before the colon, e.g,. !#HE3:L1^sylvia-s.pcx^;
    If the hero number was 17, we would put !#HE17: instead.
 e) In the event body, put the following (assuming we're changing Sylvia's portrait):

    ZVSE
    !#HE3:L1^sylvia-s.pcx^;  [Set small portrait for Sylvia]
    !#HE3:L2^sylvia.pcx^;    [Set large portrait for Sylvia]

 f) Click OK to save the event.
 g) Save your map.

If you want to set multiple custom portraits, you can add additional lines to the event.
You only need a single "ZVSE" at the top of the event.

Important: If you edit a hero that will be using a custom-designed portrait image, do NOT
click on "customize" next to the portrait as that will override the ERM command and your
customized portrait will not be used.

==============================================================================================

Enabling the Built-in Cheat Menu
--------------------------------
Heroes III comes with a built-in cheat menu that can be enabled by adding a code word to the
shortcut that starts the game. In RoE, AB and SoD, the code word used was "/nwcgrail".
In WoG, this code word has been changed to "/zvssveta".

The code word should be added after the full path and file name in the shortcut. For example,
if you have WoG installed on the F drive in a folder named "Wake of Gods", your shortcut will
look something like this:

  "F:\Wake of Gods\h3wog.exe"

Simply add "/zvssveta" to the end of it, so now it will look like this:

  "F:\Wake of Gods\h3wog.exe" /zvssveta

If you're playing WoG in window mode, the cheat menu will be in the upper-left corner of the
screen as soon as you start the game.

If you're playing WoG in full screen mode, press the F4 key on your keyboard to temporarily
switch to window mode. The cheat menu will appear in the upper-left corner of the screen.
Press F4 again to return to full screen mode.

The built-in cheat menu may be used on the adventure screen or the combat screen and
functions a bit differently for each.

Note: if the "Disable Cheat Codes and Menus" option is enabled, the Built-in Cheat Menu will
be disabled. The menu will still appear, but clicking any of the menu options does nothing.

==============================================================================================

Using the Built-in Cheat Codes
------------------------------
Heroes III comes with a list of built-in cheat codes that can be accessed by pressing the TAB
key, typing the code and pressing Enter.

The original codes (for RoE, AB and SoD) were all preceded by "nwc". In WoG 3.58, this prefix
has been changed "wog".

The codes for RoE are based on lines from the movie "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". AB
codes are based on the "Star Wars" (Episode 1) movie and SoD codes are based on the original
"Matrix" movie.

The codes for WoG are also based on a popular movie, The Lord of the Rings.

These are the codes for the following adventure map cheats:

 - build all buildings in your castle.......................WOGMINASTIRITH
 - hero gets 5 archangels in each free troop slot...........WOGGALADRIEL
 - hero gets all war machines...............................WOGOLIPHAUNT
 - hero gains a level.......................................WOGGANDALFWHITE
 - hero receives unlimited movement.........................WOGSHADOWFAX
 - reveals puzzle map.......................................WOGPALANTIR
 - reveals entire world map.................................WOGEYEOFSAURON
 - player receives 100,000 gold plus 100 of each resource...WOGISENGARD
 - hero gets all spells plus 999 spell points...............WOGSARUMAN
 - hero gains up to 50 death knights........................WOGPATHOFTHEDEAD
 - player automatically loses scenario......................WOGDARKLORD
 - player automatically wins scenario.......................WOGONERING
 - hero gains maximum luck..................................WOGBILBO
 - replaces the shroud over the entire map..................WOGMORDOR
 - hero gains maximum morale................................WOGFELLOWSHIP
 - increases colour saturation..............................WOGSARUMANOFMANYCOLORS

In addition, there are three cheat codes that may be used in the combat screen:

 - automatically win the combat.............................WOGFRODO
 - automatically lose the combat............................WOGDENETHOR
 - hero gets all spells plus 999 spell points...............WOGGANDALF

Note: if the "Disable Cheat Codes and Menus" option is enabled, entering the cheat codes
does nothing.

==============================================================================================

Enabling the WoG "Cheat" Menu, for Map and Script Testing
---------------------------------------------------------
A scripted "Cheat" menu has been added to WoGify.

To enable this menu in a map, follow these simple instructions:

 a) Create a timed event in your map (you can name it anything).
 b) Set the event so it won't trigger for any players and set the event day to 600.
 c) In the event body, put the following:

    ZVSE
    !#UN:P77/1;

 d) Click OK to save the event.
 e) Save your map.

Or you could instead put this into an unused WoGify script (e.g., script99.erm) if you want
the menu always active for all maps.

To use the WoG Cheat Menu, hold down the ALT key and click the mouse on any of the following
objects:

 a) A hero on the map (yours or another player's);
 b) A hero in your hero list;
 c) A town on the map (yours or another player's);
 d) A town in your town list.

A menu will appear and you may choose from the options given.

In addition, you can hold down the ALT key and click in the Hero screen. Doing so will bring
up a context-sensitive cheat option or menu. For example, if you want to change a hero's
attack skill, hold down ALT and click the mouse on the Attack skill. Or if you want to give
the hero an artifact, hold down ALT and click on one of the artifact slots.

Note: if the "Disable Cheat Codes and Menus" option is enabled, the WoG Cheat Menu will also
be disabled.
