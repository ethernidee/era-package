                  <P><font face="Arial">
                  <font size="2">The first thing to know is that any script you place in a map must be placed in a timed event. That is, in 
                  the map editor, go to the <i>Tools</i> menu, then select <i>Map Specifications</i>, and click on the <i>Timed Events</i> tab.<br>
                  <br>
                  Since you generally will not want the script to appear as a timed event, be certain to uncheck the box that says <i>apply event 
				  to <u>human</u> players.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Also, since you will often want to have timed events that <b>do</b> appear to the player, it is strongly recommended that you use
				  a high day number- days 500+ are suggested, since maps seldom take over a year game time to finish, and so it is very unlikely 
				  that timed events will be needed here. This conveniently gathers all your scripts at the end of the event list.<br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, you should give the event a name that describes the script.<br>
                  Now, put the script in the message portion of the event. You can type the event directly in here, or you can (and this is how I 
				  suggest you do it) write the script in the script editor, and copy it into the event.<br>
If you do use the script editor, then be certain to follow the following procedure- this will avoid a very common source of errors:<br>
                  1) If you have made any changes to the script since you last saved it, then save it again.<br>
                  2) Select the whole script (ctrl-A does this), and copy it (ctrl-C)<br>
                  3) Go to the map editor, and paste the script (ctrl-V)<br>
                  <br>
                  If you used any other editor (such as notepad) to write the script, then open the script editor, copy the script into it, 
                  and re-save. Many editors- particularly WordPad and word 
                  processors- place non-printing characters and visual 
                  formatting codes in the file, and these will cause ERM errors.<br>
                  <br>
                  ----------------------<br>
                  Now, on to actual scripting. I will assume here, and in all 
                  future instalments, that you are using a recent version of 
                  the ERM script editor, and you have the highlighter ON (that's 
                  the H button at the bottom of the scripter window). Other than 
                  that, I will not assume you know ANYTHING but what I have 
                  discussed in these posts.<br>
                  <br>
                  First, whenever you are working on a script, I suggest you 
                  first write down on a separate sheet of paper- and I actually 
                  mean to write, not use a text editor- what you want the script 
                  to do. Do some brainstorming to see how you like it to be, and 
                  do a general sketch of the script's flow.<br>
                  <br>
                  For example, I wrote a script that modifies the Card of 
                  Prophecy (this is script34.erm in your /data/s folder) to play 
                  around with a hero's stats, when entering battle. Fortunately, 
                  I kept my notes on the script, and can share them here. Note 
                  that when I first started this, I had <b>
                  NEVER EVEN LOOKED</b> at ERM scripting before.<br>
                  <br>
                  I started by writing the following:<br>
                  Artifact that gives, at start of battle, a random primary stat of -1 to +4. Attach to any given artifact for testing.<br>
                  That was the whole idea. Seems simple right? I thought so too. Next, I wrote the basic steps down:<br>
                  Start of battle - check if art. is equipped<br>
                  no - end<br>
                  yes- set flag, choose random number (1,2,3,4) for stat<br>
                  <br>
                  And so on. just a general sketch. I will not go into any more etail here, I just wanted to show what I did before sitting 
                  down at the scripter. Believe me, if you do this first, things will go a lot more smoothly.<br>
                  -------------------------<br>
                  Now, time to write code!<br>
                  The first line of any script is:<br>
                  <script type="erm">ZVSE</script><br>
                  This tells WoG that the timed event is a script. Without it, all your hard work will be ignored by the game.<br>
                  All commands are four characters long, and are one of three basic types, not including ZVSE. In the script editor, 
                  commands are displayed in dark red.<br>
                  <a name="triggersdum"></a><br>
                  <b>Triggers</b> are commands that say &quot;If something occurs in the game, start executing the 
                  script that follows. Almost all Triggers begin with the characters <b>!?</b><br>
                  For example, take this line of code from my Cards script (again, that is script34.erm if you are following along there):<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?BA0&v1321=1; [start of battle]</script><br>
                  This is the first trigger in my script. Don't worry about what the command does yet- I'll explain that later. However, do note the semicolon. All ERM commands <b>END</b> 
                  with a semicolon. Anything after that is considered a comment. In the scripter, anything that is a comment is shown in green.<br>
                  <a name="receiversdum"></a><br>
                  <b>Receivers</b> are commands that set, check, or modify something in the game. They are
                  not executed, unless they follow a trigger. All receivers begin with <b>!!</b><br>
                  For example:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!BA:E?v1331; [check for multiplayer]</script><br>
                  Again, note the semicolon to end the command. From the comment 
                  you can tell what this command is for, but that is for later.<br>
                  <a name="instructionsdum"></a><br>
                  Finally, <b>instructions</b> are 
                  just like receivers, except that they run only one time- when 
                  the map begins. They always begin with <b>
                  !#</b><br>
                  For example:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!#UN:P34/?v1321; [is script active?]</script> <br>
                  For those looking at the script, note all the green lines that 
                  start with <b>**</b> I use a 
                  double-asterisk to introduce a comment line. This is not 
                  necessary, and other script writers use other commenting 
                  methods. As long as you do not begin a line with a command, 
                  the line is ignored by ERM. I like to force comment lines to 
                  be recognized as such, so they stand out in green.<br>
                  <br>
                  To wrap up this first instalment, I will explain a couple 
                  simple commands, so you can do SOMETHING. The second 
                  instalment will give you a bit more to work with- but feel 
                  free to experiment.<br>
                  <br>
                  This script will simply count how often any hero has visited 
                  the upper-left corner of the map's surface layer- coordinates 
                  (0,0,0). Whenever I introduce a command, feel free to look it 
                  up in the ERM help.<br>
                  <br>
                  The first line is, of course:<br>
                  <script type="erm">ZVSE</script><br>
                  Next, we need to set a counter to 0. Since we want the counter to start at 0, and not wait for a hero to visit (0,0,0), we 
                  use an instruction. The instruction to assign a value to a 
                  variable is <b>!#VR</b><br>
                  Before we can go further, we need to choose a variable to hold 
                  the count. Normally, you should consult the
                  <a target="_parent" href="claimed.htm">List of the Claimed</a>, easily found in the ERM help 
                  file- just choose it off the index, and choose a variable that 
                  is free. For purposes of my tutorials, however, I will always 
                  use low-numbered v variables. V 
                  variables are the ones you will use most often. I will 
                  introduce the other types as needed.<br>
                  So, now use the command:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!#VRv1:S0;</script>
                  This, broken down, says:<br>
                  !#VR ...<br>
                  Perform a variable command at the start of the map<br>
                  <br>
                  ... v1 ...<br>
                  operating on variable v1<br>
                  <br>
                  ... : ...<br>
                  Any command which does anything 
                  uses a colon to separate the command from the action being 
                  taken. Triggers will not have them, but other commands will.<br>
                  <br>
                  ... S0 ...<br>
                  The S option for VR says you want to Set 
                  the value of the variable. In this case, we are setting it to 
                  0.<br>
                  <br>
                  ... ;<br>
                  As I mentioned above, a semicolon ends the command.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we need to set an event trigger. In the map, place an 
                  event at (0,0,0). It does not need to have anything in it, you 
                  just need it to be there, and allow all players to activate 
                  it, and allow it to be used multiple times.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we set the trigger:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?LE0/0/0;</script>
                  The LE trigger says &quot;When the event at the given map 
                  coordinates activates...&quot; The three numbers are the x,y, and z 
                  coordinates of the event, in that order.<br>
                  If you are looking at the ERM help for the !?LE trigger, you 
                  will notice there is also a <b>!$LE</b> 
                  trigger (a dollar-sign instead of a question-mark). This say 
                  &quot;After the event at the given coordinates is finished...&quot; If 
                  the map event does something without ERM, you may want the 
                  script to run after it, instead of before. In this example, it 
                  doesn't matter which one we use, since the event is blank.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next, we need to add one to the counter. This uses another VR 
                  command, but this time we use a receiver (!! instead of !#):<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:+1;</script>
                  ERM uses a + to indicate addition, as you would expect. So 
                  this command says &quot;add 1 to variable v1.&quot; The other math 
                  operators are:<br>
                  subtraction uses - (a minus sign)<br>
                  multiplication uses * (an asterisk)<br>
                  division uses : (a colon)<br>
                  modulus (remainder when dividing) uses % (a percent sign)<br>
                  Note that except when using an e 
                  variable, all arithmetic is done as integers, so 7 divided by 
                  4 is 1, not 1.75.<br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, we need to show a message to the player saying how 
                  often anyone has come to this spot:<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!IF:M^You are visitor number %V1 to the Northwest corner of the surface!^;</script>
                  IF is the command to open an interface with the player. This 
                  can be as simple as displaying a message- as I have done here- 
                  or to ask questions, give dialogues, display images, and so 
                  on.<br>
                  The M option says &quot;Display the message between the carats.&quot; 
                  There are only a few restrictions with what can be in a 
                  message. You cannot use a carat, a semicolon, or a comma. You 
                  also need to be careful with a percent- it is special. If you 
                  want to display a %, you need to type %%.<br>
                  You probably noticed I have a single % in the message. If you 
                  use a single %, then the next thing is something special you 
                  need. In this case, %V1 (note that the V is capitalized, even 
                  though the variable uses a 
                  lower-case v) shows the value of variable v1. If you look at 
                  the help for !!IF, you will see the list of % commands.<br>
                  <br>
                  That's it for the script. So, placing it all together in one 
                  place, we have, with comments added:<br>
                  </font><script type="erm">ZVSE

                  <P><font face="Arial" size="2">
                  I am going to take the 5-line script developed at the end of 
                  part 1, and expand it. What the script will do is make it so 
                  that every 10 times anyone visits the NW corner of the map, 
                  the world become magically strong, weak, or normal, cyclically. 
                  In other words, after 10 heroes have visited, all heroes' 
                  spell powers, in combat, will be doubled. After 20, combat 
                  spell power will be set to 1, and after 30, spell power will 
                  be reset to normal. The cycle then repeats.<br>
                  <br>
                  First, we are going to insert a new line, between the !!VR and 
                  !!IF commands. This line will check to see if you are the (10*n)th 
                  visitor to the site. Since this value is not needed to be kept 
                  after the script runs, I will use a temporary variable. The 
                  temporary variables in ERM are the <b>y</b> 
                  variables. They are not saved between scripts, so you cannot 
                  use them for permanent storage. However, you can also rest 
                  assured that you will not mess up other's scripts when using 
                  them. So let's add the line:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRy1:Sv1%10; [is v1 a multiple of 10?]</script>
                  <br>
                  This command uses two operators in one statement. All math is 
                  done from left to right in ERM. Remember that if you have 
                  several operations to perform- it may be easier to split it 
                  into several lines. In this case, we first set variable y1 to 
                  the value of v1, and then find the remainder when divided by 
                  10. If y1 is 0, then we know that v1 is a multiple of 10.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, if it isn't a multiple of 10, then nothing will happen, 
                  and we can just display the message that we had before. 
                  However, a small change needs to be made:<br>
<script type="erm">!!IF&y1<>0:M^You are visitor number %V1 to the Northwest corner of the  surface!^; [show message if nothing else happens]</script>
                  <br>
                  Aside from a change in the comment, I have added,
before the colon, the condition <b>&amp;y1<>0</b> The ampersand says &quot;only do this command if the following is true.&quot; the rest says  
that y1 is not equal to 0. Thus, this message will only be displayed if nothing else happens, other than the counter 
                  increasing.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, if v1 *IS* a multiple of ten, we want to have the message 
                  indicate that magic as been shuffled around. But for this, we 
                  need to find out which change is being made. So, we will use 
                  another y-variable to check this:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRy2:Sv1:10%3; [find magic change type]</script>
                  <br>
                  This takes v1 and divides it by 10, then finds the remainder 
                  when this is divided by 3. This will give variable y2 the 
                  value of 0 if v1 is less than 10, between 30 and 39, between 
                  60 and 69, and so on. y2 will be 1 if v1 is between 10 and 19, 
                  40 and 49, etc. y2 will be 2 in the other areas. Note that 
                  even if v1 is NOT a multiple of 10, this is being calculated.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now we need three more IF commands- one for each type of 
                  change. However, I can introduce a few more concepts by taking 
                  a slightly longer route.<br>
                  We want to have a message that says &quot;You are visitor number 
                  [whatever], you feel the world's magic power strengthen.&quot; <br>
                  We want to have another message that says &quot;You are 
                  visitor 
                  number [whatever], you feel the world's magic power weaken.&quot;
                  <br>
                  We want to have a third message that says &quot;You are 
                  visitor 
                  number [whatever], you feel the world's magic power return to 
                  normal.&quot; <br>
                  Notice that these three things say almost the exact same 
                  sentence- only a couple words change. We really don't want to 
                  do all that typing. This is particularly true if we later want 
                  to add more possibilities.<br>
                  <br>
                  For this, we are going to use a z 
                  variable. z variables are the only ones that can store actual 
                  text values. Just like v variables, z variables are 
                  permanently kept. However there are a few z variables that are 
                  temporary, like the y variables. A quick look at
                  Flags and Variables in the ERM 
                  help shows that the temporary z's are z-1 through z-10. Let's 
                  use variable z-1 to hold that little bit of text that changes. 
                  This will take three lines:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRz-1&y2=0:S^return to normal.^; [for visit 30, 60, 90, ...]
                  !!VRz-1&y2=1:S^strengthen.^; [for visit 10, 40, 70,...]
                  !!VRz-1&y2=2:S^weaken.^; [for visit 20, 50, 80, ...]</script>
                  At this point you should be able to understand these lines 
                  completely. Together, they set variable z-1 to the appropriate 
                  end of the message we want to display. Note that the rules for 
                  placing text in a z variable are identical to the rules for 
                  placing text in an IF:M command: You can use % commands to use 
                  other variables within them, if you need to, and you need to 
                  type %% for a percent character. Carats, semicolons, and 
                  commas are still not allowed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now we need to display the new message:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!IF&y1=0:M^You are visitor number %V1, you feel the magic power of the world %Z-1.^; [show change message]</script>
                  <br>
                  This time, the condition is that y1 
                  equals 0. We only want this message to appear if a 
                  change is happening.<br>
                  We have now gotten all of our messages out of the way. Next 
                  comes the code to modify hero statistics in battle.<br>
                  I am going to add a comment line here- remember that in the 
                  script editor this will appear in green:<br>
                  <script type="erm">** in-battle effects routine starts here</script>
				  
                  We need to check for a battle starting. This means we need a 
                  new trigger- for the start of a battle:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?BA0;</script>
                  Since we have used a new trigger, the previous code will stop 
                  running when it gets here. The BA trigger looks for battles. 
                  BA0 (that's a zero, not an o) is the trigger for the
                  start of a battle. We will need 
                  another trigger for the end of the battle as well.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, as many of you will know from reading other threads, 
                  battle scripts often have problems in human-vs.-human, network 
                  multiplayer battles. Although this script should not have a 
                  problem here, I am going to check for this case, and not allow 
                  the script to run in this case. There is a special command for 
                  this check:<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!BA:E?y1; [is this a network battle?]</script>
                  This is a BA receiver. The E option says &quot;find out what kind 
                  of battle is occurring.&quot; ?y1 says take the result of the BA:E 
                  command and store it in y1. Note that I am reusing y1 from 
                  before- that is the advantage of temporary variables: you 
                  don't have to worry about old contents when you want to use 
                  them.<br>
                  <br>
                  Checking the ERM help will tell you what values y1 may now 
                  have:<br>
                  If the battle is between an AI hero and a human player, on the 
                  AIs turn, at a computer other than the host, then y1 is set to 
                  2.<br>
                  If it is between two humans, other than hot-seat, y1 is set to  1.<br>
                  Otherwise, y1 is set to 0.<br>
                  Now, we only want the script to run in the last case. Until 
                  you learn what types of battle scripts work in cases 1 and 2, 
                  it is safest to do this. We now had the next line:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!FU1&y1=0:Pv1; [if not, continue the script]</script>
                  This is a new receiver. The FU receiver calls another script 
                  function, in this case function 1. Again, we have the 
                  condition that y1 is 0. If not, the function will not start. 
                  The option P means that the following parameters need to be 
                  passed into the function. Although it is not necessary in this 
                  case, I have passed in variable v1. This will let me 
                  manipulate v1 inside the function, without changing the stored 
                  value.<br>
                  We do not need to do anything else at the start of a battle, 
                  so we can now go right on to the function.<br>
                  <br>
                  We start by using a function trigger, to indicate a new code 
                  section, along with a comment:<br>
                  <script type="erm">** start of pre-battle
                  !?FU1;</script>
                  <br>
                  Since we want to modify the spell power of any heroes in the 
                  battle, we need to know which heroes are fighting, if any, on 
                  both the attacking and defending sides. This is done with two 
                  battle receivers:<br>
                  <script type="erm">
                  !!BA:H0/?v5; [get number of attacking hero]
                  !!BA:H1/?v6; [get number of defending hero]</script>
                  The H option asks for a hero number. H0 refers to the 
                  attacker, H1 refers to the defender. If there is NO defending 
                  hero, then BA:H1 returns a value of -2. All the hero numbers 
                  are listed in the ERM help file under
                  format H, but since we are applying this routine to all 
                  heroes, we don't care about specific numbers. I chose to use 
                  v5 and v6 to hold these numbers, because I have a special 
                  purpose intended for v3 and v4 later, and I wanted the hero 
                  numbers in adjacent variables, for my bookkeeping.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we need to find out what kind of spell power change to 
                  apply. Since we stored that in a y variable above, we may not 
                  still have the value in memory- and we should assume not. 
                  However, we do have the counter in v1. So, let's get the 
                  change type again:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRx1::10%3; [get magic change type]</script>
                  This looks familiar, but there have been a few changes. First, 
                  note that I used variable <b>x</b>1, 
                  not <b>v</b>1. This is because this 
                  statement is changing the value of the variable, but we do not 
                  want to change the counter. x variables are numbered from x1 
                  through x15, and they contain the parameters that were passed 
                  into the function from the FU receiver. Since I passed in v1, 
                  x1 has that value. There is also an x16, and you
                  can pass in a 16th variable, but 
                  x16 has a special purpose (which will be dealt with later), 
                  and so you should avoid using it if possible. Also note that x 
                  variables can only hold integer values, so you cannot pass in 
                  a z-variable to a function.<br>
                  Also, do not be worried about the double colon. The first 
                  colon separates the VR receiver from the options. The second 
                  is the division operator. Now, x1 contains the value that y2 
                  did in the first part of the script.<br>
                  <br>
                  We are almost ready now. We simply need to find out what the 
                  heroes' spell powers are.<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!HEv5:F?y5/?y6/?y3/?y7; [get stats of attacker]
                  !!HEv6&v6>=0:F?y5/?y6/?y4/?y7; [get stats of defender]</script>
                  The HE receiver is used to modify any and all aspects of a 
                  hero. The first line looks at the hero whose number is in v5, 
                  the second line at v6. In the second line, we add in the check 
                  v6>=0, so that if there is no defender, WoG doesn't try to 
                  look for hero -2. This would cause an error when the script 
                  ran.<br>
                  The F option says to look at the hero's primary skills. the 
                  next four numbers are separated by slashes, and are the 
                  attack, defence, spell power, and knowledge skills, in that 
                  order. If you just place a number or variable there, it 
                  changes the hero's stat to that value. If you place a ? before 
                  a variable name, then it takes the current value and stores it 
                  in the variable. In this case, variables y3 and y4 will 
                  contain the spell powers for the heroes. variables y5, y6, and 
                  y7 are only there as place-holders, and so I could reuse them.<br>
                  <br>
                  At this point, I should note that it is a good idea to keep 
                  track on a separate paper what every variable holds. This will 
                  help if you should forget.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we need to set up the changes- specifically, figure out 
                  exactly how much of a change will be done to the spell power. 
                  Since we will need to know what the change is later (when we 
                  restore the old values), we will store these in two more 
                  v-variables. I will use variables v3 and v4, corresponding to 
                  y3 and y4. This is why I skipped them earlier.<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv3&x1=1:Sy3; [if magic strengthened, spell power increases]
                  !!VRv3&x1=2:S1-y3; [if magic is weakened, spell power reduces to 1]
                  !!VRv4&x1=1/v6>=0:Sy4; [if magic strengthened, spell power increases]
                  !!VRv4&x1=2/v6>=0:S1-y4; [if magic is weakened, spell power reduces to 1]</script>
                  The new thing seen here is in the 3rd and 4th lines. The slash 
                  in the conditions is the same as a logical &quot;and&quot;. So, 
                  &amp;x1=1/v6>=0 says &quot;if x1=1 and v6>=0, then do the command.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Now we just need to make the changes:<br>
                  <script type="erm"> !!HEv5&x1<>0:Fd0/d0/dv3/d0; [modify spell power]
                  !!HEv6&x1<>0/v6>=0:Fd0/d0/dv4/d0;  [same for defender]</script>
                  Here, we are modifying the heroes' stats, but only if x1 is 
                  not 0. Remember that if x1 is 0, then our counter indicated 
                  that there is no change to magic power. Again, we use the HE:F 
                  command. The <b>d</b> before any number or variable says that the number or variable should be 
                  ADDED to the current stat. d0 leaves the statistic alone.<br>
                  <br>
                  We have now finished the before-battle function!<br>
                  To recap, our script now looks like:<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">ZVSE

                  Note how the comment lines help see the sections.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, after the battle, we need to undo the changes. First, we 
                  do a post-battle trigger:<br>
                  <script type="erm">** post-battle starts here
                  !?BA1;
                  !!BA:E?y1; [network battle?]
                  !!FU2&y1=0:Pv1; [if not, undo changes]</script>
                  Looks familiar, right? well, the only changes are in the 
                  trigger, and the function number. The trigger is now BA<b>1</b>, 
                  this means this triggers at the END of battle. And, since we 
                  ant to change the stats back, we need a separate function. 
                  Fortunately, we stored the hero numbers and changes in 
                  v-variables, so we don't need to calculate them again.<br>
                  Let's start the clean-up:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?FU2;
                  !!VRx1::10%3; [get change type]
                  !!VRv3:*-1; [negate attacker's changed stat]
                  !!VRv4:*-1; [negate defender's changed stat]
				  </script>
                  Since v3 and v4 have the changes to spell power, we multiply 
                  by -1. Now, if we add them as we did before, it will undo our 
                  change.<br>
                  <script type="erm">
                  !!HEv5&x1<>0:Fd0/d0/dv3/d0; [restore attacker's power]
                  !!HEv6&x1<>0/v6>=0:Fd0/d0/dv4/d0; [restore defender's power]
				  </script>
                  Again, we have the check that spell power was altered, and 
                  that there was a defender in the second line.<br>
                  We had to store the hero numbers because if a hero was beaten, 
                  it will be in the hero pool, not the battlefield at this time- 
                  we would not be able to get the number at this point.<br>
                  Our script is now done!<br>

                  <P><font face="Arial" size="2">
                  Up to now, the script that we have been designing only 
                  activates when someone visits the NW corner of the map. Why 
                  would anyone send his hero over there? Well, you could always 
                  place an event on the map (either as a site or a timed event), 
                  notifying the player of the special place, but I won't do 
                  that, as you don't use ERM for that. Instead, I am going to 
                  create an attraction for a player. I'll do this by placing a 
                  new object on the map. If you are following along with the map 
                  editor, look at the Towns page. If 
                  you haven't looked here before, you will find there are a lot 
                  of objects here after the 10 towns you are used to seeing (9 
                  town types, and random). Most of these objects are unscripted- 
                  that means that if you place them on a map, even if you wogify 
                  the map, they do not do anything. We are going to use one of 
                  them.<br>
                  <br>
                  For this script, I am going to use the 4th object in the 3rd 
                  row. It looks like a pentagram with small obelisks on the 
                  points, and a large obelisk in the middle. Place this on the 
                  map, as close to the corner as you can, without cutting any of 
                  the image off. If you do not normally have it on, turn on the
                  passibility tool- this places red 
                  and yellow squares on the map. Any red square cannot be passed 
                  by a hero. Any yellow square is a trigger square for the 
                  object.<br>
                  If C=no block, R=red, and Y=yellow, then this object, to the 
                  editor, looks like:<br>
                  CCCCC<br>
                  CRCRC<br>
                  RCYCR<br>
                  CCRCC<br>
                  Placed as I suggested, the yellow square should be located at 
                  (2,2,0).<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, let's modify the script to use this object, instead of 
                  the event we placed. If you have been actually doing these 
                  tutorials, you can delete the site event from the map- I will 
                  not be using it again.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we are going to replace the !?LE line, to attach our 
                  script to the yellow square. Recall, the old line was:<br>
                  <script type="erm"> !?LE0/0/0;  [when event at NW corner of surface is visited]</script>
                  Now, we simply change the location to the yellow square 
                  (2,2,0), and change the command from LE to OB:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?OB2/2/0; [when object at (2,2,0) is visited]</script>
                  Notice that the OB trigger is exactly the same as an LE 
                  trigger in format. If you had no problems with what LE did, 
                  then you'll have no problems with OB. Just remember that LE 
                  stands for<b> L</b>ocal <b>
                  E</b>vent, and OB stands for <b>
                  OB</b>ject, and you will know when 
                  to use each one.<br>
                  Now the script will work just as it did before, except now the 
                  site we just placed will activate it. However, I am going to 
                  make one more change to the line:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!$OB2/2/0; [AFTER object at (2,2,0) is visited]</script>
                  I have changed this from a pre-visit trigger (!?), to a 
                  post-visit trigger (!$). Currently, this doesn't have any 
                  effect on the script, but it will after we add something else 
                  to the script- we are going to add in a resident to the site, 
                  who will give you the option to advance the magic counter by 
                  five if you pay 100 gold, otherwise it will count only one. 
                  Further, We are going to place an existing object there- since 
                  it makes sense,  move the pentagram, and replace it with a 
                  star-axis. This is just my choice- if you want, replace it 
                  with any Shadow of Death site that has a function. Just be 
                  certain to only place an object that has only one yellow 
                  square, and place that square at (2,2,0).<br>
                  <br>
                  If you ran the map now, then when you visit this star axis 
                  (and only <b>THIS</b> star axis), 
                  you will get your usual +1 spell power (or nothing if your 
                  hero was there previously), and then the counter will 
                  increase.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, let us script in a creature with a &quot;mystical magic stand&quot; 
                  set up outside the star axis. I think that due to the nature 
                  of the script, a faerie dragon proprietor is best. <br>
                  <br>
                  Anyway, let's start scripting:<br>
                  <script type="erm"> !?OB2/2/0; [When object at (2,2,0) is visited]</script>
                  This is simply the pre-visit trigger, just as the post-visit 
                  trigger looked, since the same object is being visited.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we need to code in a yes/no question. <br>
                  The first thing we have to realize is that we are going to ask 
                  a question that needs to be answered. This causes a problem if 
                  the AI sends a hero to visit the site. So, we need to see if 
                  the current player is human or AI. We do this with the <b>
                  OW</b> receiver. OW lets you check 
                  or set almost anything having to do with a player (rather than 
                  a hero). So, we script:<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!OW:C?y1; [get current player colour]
                  !!OW:Iy1/?y2; [is current player an AI?]</script>
                  The C? option checks the colour of the current player. You 
                  cannot change the current player, so the ? is part of the 
                  option here. I am storing this colour in y1. The next line uses 
                  the I option. This lets you check a colour to see if it is an 
                  AI player. The first number is the colour being checked- in 
                  this case, the colour we want is that of the current player, so 
                  I placed y1 there. The second number is the value 1 for an AI, 
                  or 0 for a human. You can actually set this to add or remove a 
                  human player from a map! For now, we just want to read this 
                  in. So now, if it is an AI's turn, y2 will get the value 1, 
                  otherwise y2 will be 0.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we can ask the question.<br>
                  Since this involves interfacing with the player, we again will 
                  need to use an <b>IF </b>receiver:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!IF&y2=0:Q1/6/0/21/134/33/0/2^You notice a small stand set up near the star axis. A  faerie dragon calls out to you, 'Have fun with the nature of magic! Only 100 gold will advance the magic  counter five times as much as it normally would when visiting the axis!'^;</script>
                  <br>
                  As you see, I added the condition y2=0 here. If the AI visits 
                  the site, it will NOT ask the question!<br>
                  Anyway, there are a LOT of numbers in this command, aren't 
                  there? There are eight of them. I am going to break this down 
                  into several parts. If you have the ERM script editor open, go 
                  to the !!IF command, and click on options 
                  and scroll down to <b>
                  Q#1/#2/#3/#4/#5/#6/#7/#8^Text^</b> to see similar 
                  information.<br>
                  <br>
                  First is the option, Q. This stands for <b>
                  q</b>uestion. Next is the number 1. This is the <b>
                  flag</b> that will hold your answer. 
                  Flags are like variables, but they can only hold two values: 0 
                  (false) and 1 (true). Unlike variables, there is no letter to 
                  indicate a variable type. For instance, v-variable 1 is 
                  written as &quot;v1&quot;, z-variable 1 is &quot;z1&quot;, flag 1, however, is 
                  just 1. I'll come back to this when we use the flag later.<br>
                  <br>
                  The next six numbers add pictures to the dialogue, under the 
                  text that is written. Each pair of numbers refers to a single 
                  picture. The first one is the object TYPE, and the second is 
                  the object SUBTYPE. What each type and subtype is can be found 
                  by going to Type and subtype of Pictures 
                  using the IF:Q command. <br>
                  In this case we have the first image listed as 6/0. Type 6 is 
                  a resource- specifically gold. The subtype for a resource is 
                  the amount you want displayed underneath. Since I made it 
                  subtype 0, there is no amount displayed- just the picture of 
                  the gold resource.<br>
                  The second image is 21/134. Type 21 is a monster picture. The 
                  subtype is the type of monster. If you click on the link in 
                  the help file, you will be given a list of them. In this case, 
                  subtype 134 is a faerie dragon.<br>
                  The third image is 33/0. Type 33 is for a primary statistic, 
                  in this case spell power. Again, the subtype is the amount, 
                  and by using 0, no amount is shown. So, when this script runs, 
                  under the text will be the images of gold, a faerie dragon, 
                  and the spell-power icon.<br>
                  <br>
                  The final number, 2, says that we want a yes/no question 
                  asked. When run, below the pictures will the the familiar 
                  accept and cancel buttons. If you select accept, the flag is 
                  set to true (1), if you select cancel, the flag is set to 0.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we need to check to see if the player has the 100 gold to 
                  spend! Again, we do this with the OW receiver. So, we code the 
                  next line:<br>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm"> !!OW:R-1/6/?y3; [find out how much gold the current player has]</script>
                  The R option means that we want to do something with a 
                  player's resources. The first number is the player <b>
                  colour</b> that we want to check. 
                  This value is 0 for red, 1 for blue, and so on. Check the 
                  format E1 for all the colours, but 
                  basically they are numbered 0 through 7, and go in the order 
                  they are listed in the game. For this script, however, I have 
                  the player colour set as -1. This means that we want to check 
                  the currently active colour, whoever it is. We already checked 
                  the active player's colour above (it is stored in y1, 
                  remember), but I chose to use this to illustrate a 
                  possibility. You need to check the syntax for each option to 
                  see if -1 can be used for the current player. It sometimes has 
                  other uses. For instance, -1 sometimes refers to the neutral (unowned) 
                  colour. <br>
                  The 6 is the resource we want to check, in this case gold. The 
                  final number is what we want to set the gold to. In this case, 
                  we are using the variable y3, and as before the use of a ? 
                  means we are reading in the amount, rather than setting it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next, we check to see what the player's answer was, and if he 
                  could afford the price. We will display an appropriate 
                  response for each case. This needs 3 IF commands- one for a no 
                  answer, one for yes and the player can afford it, and one for 
                  yes and the player cannot afford it.:<br>
                  <script type="erm"> !!IF&y2=0/-1:M^Disappointed, the dragon turns to another potential customer.^;
                  !!IF&y2=0/1/y3>=100:M^'Very good! I knew you'd want to do it!'^;
                  !!IF&y2=0/1/y3<100:M^'I'm glad you are interested, but you don't seem to have the  gold on hand. Do come again!'^;</script>
                  Here, the condition that it is a human player is is in all 
                  three. The second condition checks the flag- flag number 1- 
                  which we set based on the player's answer. In the first line, 
                  the flag number is negative. That means that we want the the 
                  flag to be FALSE for the condition to be met. In the other 
                  lines, the flag is positive, meaning we need the flag to be 
                  TRUE. In the third line, we have an additional check- do you 
                  have enough cash?<br>
                  <br>
                  Before we actually deduct the 100 gold from the player's 
                  treasury, we need to decide what the AI will do. Let us make 
                  the AI flip a coin- a 50% chance that i will spend the money. 
                  We do this with two commands:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRy4:S0R1; [coin flip]
                  !!IF&y2=1:V1/y4; [set the flag to the flip]</script>
                  You will recognize the first line, but with a new option that 
                  we haven't used before- the R option. The R option generates a 
                  random number between 0 and the value after R (in this case 
                  1), and adds that to the previous value. So, this VR receiver 
                  sets y4 to 0, and then adds either 0 or 1 to it. Effectively, 
                  this is the coin flip that we wanted.<br>
                  The next line is our old friend, IF again. This time, the 
                  condition is that it <b>IS</b> an 
                  AI's turn. The V option is used to set a flag's value. In this 
                  case, flag 1 is set to the result of the coin flip.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now that we are done with the decisions, we code in the 
                  deduction, using the OW command from above.<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!OW&1/y3>=100:R-1/6/d-100; [deduct 100 gold, if appropriate]</script>
                  The two conditions here should be clear, but just to recap, 
                  the first condition is for the flag to be set- either by the 
                  coin toss for the AI, or by the player saying &quot;yes.&quot; The 
                  second condition is that the player has enough gold. As with 
                  the spell power commands from before, we use the d operator to 
                  subtract 100 from the current value of the gold amount (well, 
                  technically we are adding -100).<br>
                  <br>
                  We only need to do one more thing, and that is note that the 
                  payment was made. Since we haven't used variable v2 yet, I 
                  will do that here:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv2:S0; [initialize v2 to 0]
                  !!VRv2&1/y3>=100:+4; [set v2 to 4 if payment was made]</script>
                  Note that although the player's gold has changed, y3 still has 
                  the amount from before the payment. Thus, the same check that 
                  we had in the OW command will work here. This part of the code 
                  is now done. However, we need to modify the part of the code 
                  we already wrote, since we need to make the counter jump, and 
                  still give the proper message.<br>
                  <br>
                  Recall the following lines from the start of the script:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:+1;  [add 1 to v1]
                  !!VRy1:Sv1%10; [is v1 a multiple of 10?]</script>
                  In this part of the script, y1 is the units digit of the 
                  counter. Which message displayed depends on whether or not y1 
                  is 0. First, we modify the first line to read:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:+1+v2; [add 1+v2 to v1]</script>
                  If payment was made, then this will add 5 to v1, otherwise it 
                  will only add 1.<br>
                  Next, we add a line after the y1 calculation:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRy1&y1<=v2:S0; [reset y1 if the multiple of 10 was jumped over]</script>
                  If the addition of 5 caused v1 to skip over a multiple of 10, 
                  then it means that v2 was 4, and so y1 is between 1 and 4. So, 
                  if y1 is less than or equal to v2, it means that the magic 
                  status should flip- so we set y1 to 0. The rest of the code 
                  can stay as it is!<br>
                  <br>
                  So now, after a slight change to the text messages, are entire 
                  script now reads:<br>
                  <script type="erm">ZVSE

                  I have introduced a lot of commands in this script. If you 
                  were looking in the script editor's help file, you almost 
                  certainly noticed that many of the commands have many more 
                  options than I have introduced. I am therefore going to 
                  elaborate on some of the commands in more detail.<br>
                  Please note that I will be following along with the help file 
                  within the editor, and so if a command is documented well 
                  enough in there, then I will only mention what an option does, 
                  but not go into the details.<br>
                  <br>
                  Going in order through the script, the first command seen is 
                  VR.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the help file, you will see the syntax at the first line:<br>
                  <b>!!VR@:XXXX</b><br>
                  Any place you see an @ in the help is a place for a variable 
                  name- specifically the one that the command is working with. 
                  XXXX always indicates that there are options that can be used 
                  with the command. If you click on Options, 
                  you will get a list of them.<br>
                  <br>
                  Most of the variables are well explained here, but I will 
                  elaborate on a few:<br>
                  <br>
                  c stores the current day- it does not store month/week/day. 
                  Thus, the 4th day of month 2 week 3 is stored as 46, as it is 
                  the 46th day of the game. If you need the month or week of the 
                  map, you can find them this way (and store in v1):<br>
                  Month: !!VRv1:Sc+27:28;<br>
                  Week: !!VRv1:Sc+6:7;<br>
                  Week of the month: !!VRv1:Sc+6:7%4+1;<br>
                  Day of the week: !!VRv1:Sc%7+1;<br>
                  <br>
                  d is used to modify a value. You can add or subtract a number, 
                  but you can only ADD a variable. So, if you wanted to subtract 
                  variable v1, you would first need to negate it, in a separate 
                  instruction. In most cases, it is best to use another, 
                  temporary variable to hold the negation, so you do not change 
                  what you are holding onto. If you keep good records of your 
                  permanent variables when scripting, then do whatever you are 
                  more comfortable with.<br>
                  <br>
                  e variables are the only ones that can hold a floating point 
                  value. In most cases, you won't need to use one, as the 
                  numeric range of the variables is very large, and so you can 
                  multiply by a fraction simply by multiplying by the numerator, 
                  and then dividing by the denominator. Only if you are going to 
                  use very large numbers in a fraction will you need these. When 
                  displayed in a message, an e-variable only gives the first 
                  three decimal places, but the stored precision is much more.<br>
                  <br>
                  w variables are actually 155 variables each- one for each hero 
                  in the game. Thus, variable w1 holds 155 values- one for each 
                  hero. w2 holds 155 values, and so on. You must use the IF:W 
                  command to tell ERM which of the 155 values you want.<br>
                  <br>
                  ERT z-variables are special variables 
                  that take in text from a supplementary file. They were 
                  introduced to make regionalization of scripts easier. In 
                  general, you should not need to worry about them, and this is 
                  all I will say on them, as it doesn't apply to basic 
                  scripting.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Options for VR:</b><br>
                  In the options, if you see a $, it means that you can either 
                  set the value (by putting a number or variable in the 
                  position) or you can read in the value to a variable by 
                  prefixing the variable name with a ?.<br>
                  If you see ?$, then you can only read in the variable.<br>
                  If you see #, then you can only set a value. Most of the time 
                  common sense will tell you what is allowed. For example, 
                  !!VRv1:+?v2; makes no sense- you can't add a number that will 
                  be stored; the number must already be available to be added.<br>
                  <br>
                  Going through the list, we have:<br>
                  <b>C$1/$2/.../$16 </b><br>
                  This allows you to read in and/or set multiple values in one 
                  statement. Up to 16 consecutive 
                  v-variables can be worked with. Thus, if you have 6 
                  numbers in the list, and the VR command is operating on 
                  variable 57, then this will set or read variables 57 through 62.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Rx</b><br>
                  This generates a random integer between 0 and x, and ADDS it 
                  to the variable in the VR command. Note that in the help file, 
                  this should read <b>R#</b>, as you 
                  can use any stored value for the limit or the random number.<br>
                  If you want to generate a number between 1 and 10, you would 
                  code it as !!VRv1:S1R9; This sets v1 to 1, and adds a number 
                  between 0 and 9 to it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>S#</b><br>
                  This sets the variable to the number given.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>T$</b><br>
                  This is another random number routine. Again, it should read
                  <b>T#</b>, as it makes no sense to 
                  set a random number- it isn't random then, is it? There is an 
                  advantage and a disadvantage to using T instead of R. The T 
                  option is a time-based generator. This makes the numbers more 
                  random than the R option, which isn't. However, if you need to 
                  generate multiple random numbers without any delay (such as 
                  showing a message), then it is likely that the system clock of 
                  your computer will not have advanced enough to give a truly 
                  random number. You may even get the same number multiple 
                  times. Thus, <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:S3T5T5T5;</script>
                  will not generate a number between 3 and 18 (simulating a roll 
                  of three dice), but rather give a random number from the 
                  choice of 3,6,9,12,15,18. If you need to do this, then <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:S3R5R5R5;</script>
                  is the better choice.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Logical operators:</b><br>
                  These are actually used anywhere you want to use a conditional 
                  expression, but since they are explained here in the help and 
                  are very useful to know in general, I will list them here. 
                  They are explained quite well in the help file.<br>
                  <br>
                  Use & to indicate a logical AND in your conditions<br>
                  Use | to indicate a logical OR<br>
                  Use X to indicate a logical XOR (exclusive or)<br>
                  Use / to indicate the same operator as previously used.<br>
                  You must have all AND conditions first, and ll OR conditions 
                  next. Note that if you have both, All the ANDs are counted 
                  together first, and then the ORs, so if at least one OR is 
                  true, the whole statement is true. This is because ERM 
                  evaluates expressions left-to-right. This also makes multiple 
                  XORs very hard, if at all possible, to code.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Arithmetic operators</b><br>
                  These were covered above, but in summary,<br>
                  + is addition<br>
                  - is subtraction<br>
                  * is multiplication<br>
                  : is division<br>
                  % is modulus<br>
                  <br>
                  Again, all math is done left-to-right. Thus,<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!VRv1:S0+5+6*3+2;</script>
                  gives v1 the value of 35 (5+6=11; 11*3=33; 33+2=35) and not 
                  25, as algebraic order would say (6*3=18; 5+18+2=25)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>String operators<br>
                  H#</b><br>
                  Set flag # to true if the z-variable is empty, and false if 
                  not.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>S^TEXT^</b><br>
                  Set the z-variable to the text between the carats. Remember 
                  that ^ and ; cannot be used in the text.<br>
                  <br>
                  Within the text string, you can show the contents of a 
                  variable by using a % followed by the variable name, using a 
                  capitol letter instead of a lower-case one. For flags, which 
                  have no letter normally, use an F. For common variables that 
                  have no numbers, prefix them with a V. Although not listed in 
                  the help file, %Z can be used for z-variables. To display a 
                  percent-sign, use %%.<br>
                  <br>
                  +<br>
                  When working with strings, + is used to concatenate two 
                  strings. either string may be a z-variable or text (within 
                  carats).<br>

                  One of the things that most people want to do is to create or 
                  change a map site. This is because sometimes there is 
                  something you want to do on a map, but there is no way to do 
                  it. Take the script from earlier in this thread. There is no 
                  map site that lets you alter the global effect of spell power, 
                  so we had to create one.<br>
                  <br>
                  In this lesson, I am going to start with the OB commands.<br>
                  <b>First, the trigger:</b><br>
                  <br>
                  As with all triggers, the command begins with <b>
                  !?</b>. Since map objects often have 
                  hard-coded effects, such as the star axis, there are two forms 
                  of the trigger.<br>
                  <b>!?</b>OB is a trigger for a 
                  script that will run before the 
                  normal effect of the map object.<br>
                  <b>!$</b>OB is a trigger for a 
                  script that will run after the 
                  normal effect of the map object.<br>
                  If you use an object which has no hard-coded effect, then 
                  either form will work. However, consider that other scripts 
                  may use the site also, and so all pre-visit scripts will run 
                  before any post-visit scripts.<br>
                  <br>
                  Both the pre-visit and post-visit triggers work the same, so I 
                  will only explain the pre-visit trigger's format. The only 
                  difference in post-visit is using !$ instead of !?<br>
                  <br>
                  You can have up to three numbers follow the trigger, each form 
                  has a different meaning:<br>
                  <br>
                  With one number, all objects of the same type as the number 
                  will cause the script to run. For example:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?OB17;</script>
                  Will trigger any time a creature dwelling (type 17) is 
                  visited. For a list of map objects, look at the
                  Format OB list.<br>
                  <br>
                  With two numbers, all objects of the same type as the first 
                  number, and the same subtype of the second number will cause 
                  the script to run. On the OB format page, anything which has 
                  subtypes has a link to the appropriate list. Example:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?OB17/81;</script>
                  Will trigger whenever a Diamond Dragon dwelling (type 17, subtype 81) is visited.<br>
                  <br>
                  With three numbers, only the object at the (x,y,level) 
                  location will trigger the code. Example:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!?OB2/2/0;</script>
                  Will trigger only when the object at (2,2) on the surface 
                  layer is visited. Note that in this last case, the location
                  must be seen in the map editor as a
                  yellow square when the
                  passability feature is turned on.<br>
                  <br>
                  ---------------<br>
                  <b>The OB receiver </b>has a 
                  different use. It is used to check or modify the attributes of 
                  an existing object. The general form for this command is:<br>
                  !!OB#1/#2/#3:XXXX;<br>
                  <br>
                  The three numbers indicate the location (x,y,level) of the 
                  object. Note that some objects have more than one yellow 
                  square, so if you are working with one of those, you need to 
                  duplicate your instructions for each such place. Of course, 
                  you could make an object with two yellow squares do different 
                  things at each. (say an &quot;entrance&quot; and an &quot;exit&quot; space). As 
                  always, XXXX indicates that there are options that can be used 
                  with this command.<br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, before I describe the options, note that some map 
                  objects have special receivers, and have additional options 
                  that are not part of the general OB formats. <br>
                  Check the list of 
                  <a href="../receivers/receivers_objects.htm">Other Objects 
                  (Miscellaneous object receivers)</a> 
                  to see if there are extra functions available for the object 
                  you are scripting. In general, these are objects that give 
                  resources, artifacts, or secondary skills. They have commands 
                  to let you specify more exactly what you want. There are 23 of 
                  these special object receivers. Note that these are only extra
                  receivers. For a trigger, the OB 
                  receiver is always sufficient, regardless of the object type.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, the general !!OB options. Note that I skip the C option, 
                  as I am uncertain of its function.:<br>
                  <b>
                  B</b><br>
                  This removes a description hint for the object. If the objects 
                  has a default hint text, this option will restore it to this 
                  message. Thus, if you make an object revert to its normal 
                  function, you can restore the hint text without manually 
                  replacing it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  D#</b><br>
                  This prevents a particular player from using this object. You 
                  may find this more convenient than hiding something behind a 
                  border guard.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  E#</b><br>
                  This allows a particular player to use the object. Note that 
                  by combining D and E commands, you can create your own style 
                  of quests, which may not be available for a seer's hut. Simply 
                  prevent a player from using an object (with D), and then when 
                  certain conditions are met, you can re-enable it (with E). 
                  This will also allow you to have multiple players able to 
                  complete the same quest.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  H$ </b> <br>
                  Read or set the hint text for an object to/from a z-variable. 
                  Remember that you do not need to store the default text- the B 
                  option lets you restore that.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  M$1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This command lets you automatically force an answer of &quot;no&quot; to 
                  a yes/no type question. As the help file indicates, this 
                  command is still in testing, so you can check there if you 
                  want the full details. In general, if you want to force a 
                  particular action at a site that normally has a question, it 
                  would be best to disable the object, and code in what you want 
                  to happen in an OB trigger command.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  R </b>and<b> S</b><br>
                  These are, respectively, enable and disable commands which 
                  apply to all players. This way you don't have to use eight D 
                  or E commands to completely turn an object on or off.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  T$</b><br>
                  This is to get or set the type of object visited. For example, 
                  if you had a diamond dragon dwelling at (4,5,1), then:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!OB4/5/1:T?y1; set variable y1 to 17.</script>
                  <br>
                  <script type="erm">!!OB4/5/1:T2;</script>
                  Would leave the graphics the same, but change the dwelling 
                  into an Altar of Sacrifice (object type 2)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>
                  U$</b><br>
                  This sets the subtype of the object. Thus, if we left the type 
                  as 17, and gave the command:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!OB4/5/1:U?24;</script> Would change it into 
                  a green-dragon dwelling. Again, it leaves the graphic as it 
                  was.<br>
                  That's all for the OB commands. My next post here will cover 
                  the fairly extensive list of !!HE options.</font><br>

                  The next thing that most people want to do, is to be able to 
                  manipulate the attributes of a hero. This can be to add new 
                  skills- or remove them! Makee them faster, change their 
                  specialty skills, and so on. Most of these changes are 
                  gathered together in the extremely powerful !!HE receiver. I 
                  only used a small fraction of this command's ability in the 
                  sample script above.<br>
                  <br>
                  There are three ways to identify a hero with this receiver. 
                  You can identify a hero by location, by hero number or by a 
                  trigger.<br>
                  To identify a hero by location, you can use the standard 
                  three-number method, as we have used before:<br>
                  !!HE4/7/0:XXXX<br>
                  This says to do XXXX to the hero located at (4,7) on the 
                  surface.<br>
                  <br>
                  To address a hero directly, you use just the hero number:<br>
                  !!HE5:XXXX<br>
                  will apply the options (remember that XXXX is a placeholder!) 
                  to hero number 5 (Sorsha) <br>
                  You can find all the hero numbers by checking Format H- there 
                  is a link on the !!HE receiver help page.<br>
                  <br>
                  If a hero has triggered some code, then you can identify him 
                  or her by using the direct format, with the hero number being 
                  -1. This is most useful if you want to make multiple sites do 
                  something, or if you want to have an artifact do something 
                  when equipped or removed- so you cannot tell where a hero will 
                  be when a script is activated.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now for the options, and there are a lot of them!<br>
                  There are four options dealing with artifacts.<br>
                  <b>A#</b><br>
                  This is used to give or take an artifact from a hero. To take 
                  an artifact, make it negative. Check format list A1 for the 
                  artifact numbers. For example,<br>
                  !!HE5:A26;<br>
                  Will give Sorsha a rib cage (artifact #26)<br>
                  !!HE5:A-7;<br>
                  Will remove any Centaur's Axes (artifact #7) from her backpack 
                  and from her hand, if equipped. Any artifact that is given 
                  this way will be placed in the hero's pack.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>A1/$1/$2;</b><br>
                  This command equips an artifact on the hero. $1 is the 
                  artifact number, and $2 is the location to be equipped. Format 
                  AP has the list of positions.<br>
                  If we wanted Sorsha to equip that rib cage we just gave her, 
                  we would code:<br>
                  !!HE5:A1/26/5;<br>
                  Equipment position #5 is the torso, the place that the rib 
                  cage should be placed. If there is already an artifact 
                  equipped there, then flag number 1 will be set to 0, otherwise 
                  it will be set to 1. You may want to have a script do 
                  something special if an artifact is already equipped where you 
                  want to place another. This also helps for equipping a 
                  miscellaneous artifact, as there are five places it can go, 
                  and some may be used. You may want to check if a slot is open 
                  first by coding:<br>
                  !!HE5:A1/?y1/5;<br>
                  y1 will have the number of the artifact on the torso.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>A2/$1/$2/$3;</b><br>
                  This checks to see if an artifact is owned or equipped. the 
                  first number is the artifact number, the second number is the 
                  quantity of that artifact owned, and the third is the number 
                  equipped. These numbers cannot be set- if you try, ERM will 
                  ignore you.<br>
                  An example from my Cards of Prophecy script:<br>
                  <br>
                  !!HEv1300:A2/47/0/?v1301; [Attacker has Cards of Prophecy 
                  equipped?] <br>
                  <br>
                  This checks to see if the hero, whose number is stored in 
                  variable v1300, has any Cards (artifact 47) equipped, with the 
                  result placed in v1301. It turns out that this command runs in 
                  a battle, so my comment reflects this- the attacking hero 
                  number was stored in v1300. The 0 for the quantity owned is 
                  purely a place-holder. As I said, you cannot set this number.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  A3/$1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This command is to remove some (but not necessarily all) 
                  copies of an artifact. Again, the first number is the artifact 
                  number. The second number says how many of these to remove, 
                  and the third number is a flag. If the flag is 1, then an 
                  equipped artifact will be removed before ones in the backpack. 
                  If it is 0, then ones in the backpack go first.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>B0/$</b><br>
                  This is to get or change the name of a hero. For example,<br>
                  !!VRz1:S^Sara^; [store text]<br>
                  !!HE5:B0/z1; [set new name]<br>
                  <br>
                  Will change Sorsha's name to Sara for the remainder of the map 
                  (or, of course, until changed again). This is useful if you 
                  want a story map, but allow the player to choose a starting 
                  hero- at the start of the map, you change the name of the hero 
                  at the place this one starts, and change his/her name.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>B1/$</b><br>
                  This command will change the biography of a hero. Maybe after 
                  a major battle, you want to acknowledge this in the hero's 
                  bio. For example:<br>
                  !!HE5:B1/?z1; [store old bio]<br>
                  !!VRz2:S^ She has conquered the Lich King's armies.^; [store 
                  text]<br>
                  !!VRz1:+z2; [add text to old bio]<br>
                  !!HE5:B1/z1; [set new bio]<br>
                  <br>
                  I think the comments explain this well enough.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next are a set of monster commands. After all, a hero will 
                  usually be accompanied by one to seven monster stacks- it 
                  would be nice to be able to work with them. There are four 
                  such options.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>C0/#1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This will take the monster stack (or lack thereof) in the 
                  hero's army slot numbered #1 and set or check the type ($2) 
                  and quantity ($3) of those creatures.<br>
                  The hero's army slots are numbered 0 though 6. Let's say we 
                  want to change all the creatures in the current hero's first 
                  army slot into peasants. Yes, this is a nasty thing to do in 
                  general, but why not? We code this as:<br>
                  !!HE-1:C0/0/139/d;<br>
                  Recall that for hero numbers, -1 means the hero that triggered 
                  whatever is happening. the 0 refers to the first slot. 139 is 
                  the monster number for a peasant. The d in the last position 
                  is a placeholder, leaving it alone- since we do not wish to 
                  change the quantity. Remember that the value d is used to add 
                  whatever number follows the d to the number in that position. 
                  Since there is no number after the d, no change is made. d0 
                  would have had the same (lack of) effect.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>C1/#1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This works similar to C0, but instead of looking at creatures 
                  in slot #1, is changes all 
                  creatures of type #1 to type $2. So,<br>
                  !!HE-1:C1/132/139/d;<br>
                  Will change all of a hero's azure dragons (type 132) into 
                  peasants. (This is not an action a map designer should take 
                  lightly, as you may find nobody will play your maps anymore! 
                  :-)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>C2/#1/#2/#3</b><br>
                  This gives a stack of monsters of type #1 and quantity #2 to 
                  the hero. #3 is an instruction for what to do if there are no 
                  open army slots. If #3 is 1, then the player will get the 
                  &quot;make room for these creatures&quot; dialogue. If it is 2, then the 
                  AI will make the choice automatically. Most of the time, you 
                  will want to check if the hero is owned by a human or the AI, 
                  and set the flag accordingly.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>C#1/#2/.../#14</b><br>
                  This is similar to C2, but gives up to 7 extra stacks of 
                  monsters. You must supply all 14 
                  parameters. The odd numbered positions are the creature types, 
                  and the even numbered positions are the quantities. Use -1 to 
                  indicate no creature (so you can give less than 7 stacks.<br>
                  For instance, if you want to offer one of each of the 
                  Armageddon's Blade dragons to Fafnir (hero 37), you would 
                  code:<br>
                  !!HE37:C132/1/133/1/134/1/135/1/-1/0/-1/0/-1/0;<br>
                  <br>
                  For all remaining examples, I will be 
                  using hero -1 (current hero), if it is allowed.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>D</b><br>
                  This calls an upgrade dialogue- similar to the one you get at 
                  a hill fort.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>E$<br>
                  E$1/$2</b><br>
                  These are used to check or modify a hero's experience. If you 
                  have two numbers, the first number is for experience total, 
                  the second is for the hero level. Do NOT set both of them. I 
                  strongly suggest that you only use the one-number version if 
                  you are changing a hero's experience total, and use the 
                  two-number form to check the hero's level. In the two-number 
                  form, you can also add a /1 to the end, which will prevent the 
                  game from redrawing the screen. In some cases, this may 
                  prevent graphical artifacts from appearing on the screen when 
                  the script runs. several other options also have a no-redraw 
                  command. Check the help file for which ones do.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thus, to give 1000 experience, you would code:<br>
                  !!HE-1:Ed1000;<br>
                  To increase the hero's level by 2:<br>
                  !!HE-1:E?y1/d2;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>F$1/$2/$3/$4</b><br>
                  This command gets or changes the hero's attack ($1), defence 
                  ($2), spell power ($3), and knowledge ($4). If you are 
                  checking the statistics only, then 
                  you can use the /1 option at the end. This will give you the 
                  hero's base statistics, rather than their values after 
                  artifacts are included. You may recall this one being used in 
                  our spell-power script.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  H$1/$2/$3/$4</b><br>
                  This lets you set the monsters for new heroes in the hero 
                  pool, when they appear in the tavern. This sets the monsters 
                  in slot $1 to type $2, with a range of $3 through $4. You can 
                  only set the first three slots (0,1,2) for these heroes. Also, 
                  the game randomly decides if there will be 2 or 3 monster 
                  stacks for new heroes, so you can force a hero to have 2 
                  monster stacks by setting slot 2 to creature type -1, but you 
                  cannot force a hero to get three creature stacks. You can, of 
                  course, set slot 1 to -1 also to force only one stack.<br>
                  Also note that any heroes that are 
                  currently available in any player's taverns will not 
                  have his or her armies modified until the next week.<br>
                  Also, note that the examples in the help file may be missing 
                  the colons in the syntax (it may be fixed in an update I 
                  haven't installed yet). Otherwise they are correct.<br>
                  <br>
                  For example, to have Orrin start with only one creature in 
                  slot 1, you would code:<br>
                  !!HE0:H0/?y1/1/1;<br>
                  I read in the creature type, so it is not altered.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>I$<br>
                  I$/1</b><br>
                  Similar to the F option, this options lets you change the 
                  spell point total. Note that it is possible to give a hero 
                  negative spell points with this command. It won't cause a 
                  problem, but it can be confusing to the player to see spell 
                  points listed as -6/30 or something similar. Obviously, you 
                  cannot cast spells if you have less than 0 spell points.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>K</b><br>
                  This command kills the hero, immediately. I don't think 
                  further explanation is needed here.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>L#^path\filename.pcx^</b><br>
                  This lets you change the portraits of the hero. If # is 1, 
                  then you are setting the small portrait- such as the one in 
                  the hero list. If the # is 2, you are setting the large 
                  portrait- like the one in the hero screen. Inside the carats 
                  is the location of the pcx file, relative to the
                  DATA directory in the heroes3 
                  folder.<br>
                  The total length of the path+filename can only be 12 
                  characters, so it is best to have these files in the data 
                  directory, rather than elsewhere. For instance, if you have 
                  the pictures in the maps directory, the filename would have to 
                  start with &quot;..\maps\&quot; this already uses eight of your 12 
                  characters. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>L3</b><br>
                  This restores the portraits to the defaults.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>L#/$</b><br>
                  If # is 0, the portrait of the hero is set to portrait number 
                  $; IF # is 4, both the large and small portraits are set.<br>
                  <br>
                  I am uncertain of the use for the L5 option, and of the 
                  indexing in L0 and L4 (although I believe portrait number $ is 
                  the portrait of hero number $)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M#1/$2</b><br>
                  This checks or sets a spell inside a hero's spell book. #1 is 
                  the spell- format SP lists all the spell codes, and $2 is a 
                  flag. If the flag is 0, the spell is not in the book (or will 
                  be removed if you set it). If the flag is 1, then the spell is 
                  in the book (or will be added). You should check to see that a 
                  hero has a spell book equipped first- easily done with the 
                  following:<br>
                  !!HE-1:A2/0/0/?y1;<br>
                  This checks to see if a spell book (artifact 0) is equipped. y1 
                  will be 1 if there is a spell book, and it will be 0 if not.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>N?$</b><br>
                  This gets the hero number for the hero. This is good if you 
                  want a site to work differently for different heroes. You can 
                  use the hero-location, or triggering hero form of the !!HE 
                  receiver for the script, and get the hero number with this 
                  option.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>O$</b><br>
                  This sets or checks the owner of a hero. -1 indicates no 
                  owner, and 0 through 7 indicates the various colours. You can 
                  use this command to have a script only effect certain players, 
                  or even to cause heroes to change allegiance. You can even add 
                  a new player into the game by setting to an unused colour!<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>P$1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This command moves the hero to location ($1,$2,$3). You can 
                  use this to teleport a hero without a lith, or to bring a hero 
                  out of the hero pool, directly onto the map. Of course, moving 
                  an un-owned hero onto the map should be followed by an HE:O 
                  command, to give ownership of the hero to one of the players.<br>
                  If you want a teleport sound when moving a hero, then you can 
                  add an additional /$ to the end of the option. if $ is not 0, 
                  you will get a sound. According to the help file, you cannot 
                  use this option with the active player's hero. I have not 
                  tested this, so cannot confirm or deny this.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>R#/$</b><br>
                  This sets or checks various small parameters for a hero. If # 
                  is 0, then you are setting or checking the hero's morale. This 
                  is, of course, only guaranteed to be accurate until a battle. 
                  If # is 1, you are setting or checking luck. If # is 2, you 
                  are checking the hero gender. Some dialogues will sound better 
                  if you check this first, and modify the text to get pronouns 
                  correct. If # is 4, then you are checking the tactics control 
                  of the hero. -1 indicates it is enabled, 0 indicates disabled.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>R3/$1/$2</b><br>
                  This sets the availability of a hero to be hired. If $1 is 1, 
                  the hero can be hired. If it is 0, then the hero cannot. If $2 
                  is left out, this is for all players. If $2 is present, it is 
                  checking for individual players. This uses the bit-notation 
                  value, so red=1, blue=2, tan=4, green=8, and so on. Add the 
                  numbers for all the colours you want to set.<br>
                  Disabling an active hero will kill it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>S#1/$2</b><br>
                  This option is used to set or check what secondary skills a 
                  hero has. The first number is the skill number (format SS 
                  lists them), and the second number is the skill level, with 0 
                  being no skill, 1 being basic, 2 being advanced, and 3 being 
                  expert.<br>
                  If a hero is given more than 8 secondary skills, s/he will 
                  still gain the benefits of all of them, but only the first 8 
                  will be seen on the hero screen. For example, in my Cards 
                  script, if knowledge is changed, I need to adjust the spell 
                  points as well. To do this, I need to check if the hero has 
                  the intelligence skill (skill 24), so I used this line:<br>
                  <script type="erm">!!HEx1:S24/?y9;</script>
                  Here, x1 is the first parameter passed into a function- my 
                  script sends the hero number for the effected hero this way.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  T$1/$2/$3/$4/$5</b><br>
                  This forces a hero into a battle against monsters of type $4, 
                  and quantity $5. The battle will take place on the terrain of 
                  the type found at location ($1,$2,$3) on the map. The hero 
                  will not move to that place- the location is only to get 
                  things such as native terrain bonuses, and the background 
                  picture.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>U$1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This command will check or alter the patrol area for an AI 
                  hero. Although the patrol cannot be moved to another level, 
                  the x and y location for the center of the patrol can be set 
                  to ($1,$2), with a radius of $3. A patrol radius of -1 frees 
                  the hero from patrolling.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  V#1/$2<br>
                  V#1/#2/$3</b><br>
                  This is used to set or check if a map site has been visited. 
                  This is specifically for 10 objects- they are all listed in 
                  the scripter help file. For both forms, the first number is 
                  the type of map site.<br>
                  In the first form, the second number is the bit-value of all 
                  32 sites. (you cannot have more than 32 of certain objects on 
                  the map). Thus, 1=the first site, 2= the second, 4=the third, 
                  and so on, up to 2,147,483,648 for the 32nd site. Add the 
                  numbers to set all of them- if the site has been visited, add 
                  in its value, if not skip it. Obviously, if you only have a 
                  few sites on the map, you don't need to worry about the 
                  high-powers of 2 that appear. Use the calculator that comes 
                  with Windows to type the number in binary, and convert to 
                  decimal if you don't want to chance making an error by hand.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you don't want to check or set all of them- and usually you 
                  will only be interested in one at a time, then you use the 
                  second form. In this form, the second number is a number from 
                  0 through 31- indicating which of the sites you want to set. 
                  $3 is a flag value, set to 1 if the hero has visited the site, 
                  and set to 0 if not. By use of this, you can allow heroes to 
                  revisit sites that are normally one-time only.<br>
                  <br>
                  The help file has several good examples, so check them out if 
                  you need them.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>W$</b><br>
                  This lets you check or modify the hero's movement points. 100 
                  movement points is roughly equal to one step horizontally or 
                  vertically, on terrain with no penalty or road. Note that if a 
                  hero has movement changed, then even if the hero has not moved 
                  that day, s/he will be unable to dig for the grail. The 
                  double-movement Wogify option had this problem. I believe that 
                  it was fixed for 3.57f, but the change may not have made it 
                  (and will appear in a script update sometime soon)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X</b><br>
                  All the X options deal with hero specializations.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X0/$</b><br>
                  This sets the hero's specially to the secondary skill with 
                  number $. Not all secondary skills make sense for a specialty- 
                  but of course you could always write a script that does make, 
                  say, a wisdom specialist have meaning.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X1/$</b><br>
                  This makes the hero a creature master, of creature type $, and 
                  if the creature is upgradeable, also the upgrade. This involves 
                  giving all creatures of that type +1 speed, and an attack and 
                  defence bonus proportional to the hero level divided by the 
                  creature level. (always at least 1 bonus point to each)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X2/$</b><br>
                  This makes the hero generate resource of type $ daily.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X3/$</b><br>
                  This makes the hero specialty spell number $. Again, not all 
                  spells make sense- for instance what does a specialization in 
                  dispel do?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X4$1/$2/$3/$4</b><br>
                  This gives the hero a creature specialty in creature type $1, 
                  giving a flat bonus of $2 attack, $3 defense, and $4 damage. 
                  Again, if the creature has an upgrade, it will gain the bonus 
                  also.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X5/2</b><br>
                  This is to set the specialty to Sir Mulloch's specialty (+2 
                  creature speed to all creatures).<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X6/$1/$2/$3</b><br>
                  This allows the hero to upgrade creatures of types $1 and $2 
                  (and possibly their upgrades, if any) to type $3. Cost will be 
                  the difference in purchase price between the base and upgraded 
                  forms.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X7/$1/$2</b><br>
                  This makes the hero's specialty a flat attack ($1) and defense 
                  ($2) bonus to all dragons.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X8/1</b><br>
                  This causes the hero to spread a shroud of darkness wherever 
                  s/he travels.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>X8/2</b><br>
                  This allows the hero to rebuild towns that have been destroyed 
                  as any town type (rather than just the old type or the hero's 
                  type)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Y$1/$2/$3/$4</b><br>
                  This sets or changes a blessing or curse that has been placed 
                  on the hero. The blessing or curse type is type $1- and there 
                  is a list of them in the scripter help. The link is in the 
                  HE:Y description. $2 is the power of the curse or blessing 
                  (how severe it is). $4 says what to do with the curse. If $4 
                  is 0, then the blessing or curse is removed. If $4 is 1, then 
                  the curse or blessing is to last for $3 days. If $4 is 2, then 
                  the duration of the curse or blessing will be extended by the 
                  amount $3. A negative value in $3 will reduce the duration of 
                  an existic blessing or curse of the same type (if one is 
                  present)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Y2/$2/$3/#</b><br>
                  Curse type 2 prevents a hero from using a particular artifact 
                  slot. $2 is which slot is sealed. If $2 is -1, then a random 
                  slot is chosen. $3 is the duration, as above, and # is the 
                  set/remove/extend option, as $4 in the other curses.<br>
                  <br>
                  I have left out examples for many of the options. Feel free to ask for an example. I think my explanations are good enough, 
                  but I could be wrong :-/</font><br>

<font class="Helvetica32" face="Arial" size="2">All <font color="#000000"><i>Triggers</i>,

  <strong><font color="red"><font color="blue">Header</font> <font color="darkmagenta">[</font>:<font color="blue">Body</font><font color="darkmagenta">]</font>
  ;</font></strong><br>
Optional elements are in square brackets. In particular, triggers have no Body. <br>
 Header contains information about what kind of object it denotes: Trigger (T), Receiver (R) or Instruction (I), also it contains
  optional information whether the object executable.<br>
 Body contains executable ERM commands, according to type of the object (R or I).</font> <br>
<tt style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">
All ERM commands (receivers, instructions) have to use at least one parameter in order to work correctly.</font></tt></p>
  <p><font class="Helvetica32" face="Arial" size="2"><u><font color="#000000">Headers</font></u>
have the following format:
  <strong><font color="red">
  !<font color="darkmagenta">{</font>?<font color="darkmagenta">|</font>!<font color="darkmagenta">|</font>#<font color="darkmagenta">}</font>AB
  <font color="darkmagenta">[ <font color="blue">Identifier</font> ] [ <font color="blue">Conditions</font>
  ]</font></font></strong><br>
  Select only one element from elements in braces
  separated by '|'( '?','!','#'- means T, R, I accordingly ). <br>
 String 'AB' defines the type of the T, R or I (see later). <br>
 Identifier - number denotes object. <br>
  Conditions - conditions of &quot;execution&quot; of the following Body for R and I or all R-s for T. <br>
 If there are no Conditions, then T, R, I executes
  &quot;unconditionally&quot;.<br>
<br>
 <u><font color="#000000">Identifiers</font></u> have the following format:
  <strong><font color="red"><font color="blue">
  N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[</font>/<font color="blue">N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[</font>/<font color="blue">N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[...]]]</font></font></strong><br>
Symbols 'N' mean decimal numbers, number of which depends on type T, R, I (see later).<br>
<br>
<u><font color="#000000">Conditions</font></u> have the following format:
  <strong><font color="red">
  &<font color="blue">N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[</font>/<font color="blue">N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[</font>/<font color="blue">N</font><font color="darkmagenta">[...]]]</font></font></strong><br>
Symbol '&' separates numbers in Conditions from
  Identifier. <br>
 Execution can depend on <font color="darkgreen">Conditional Flags (CF)</font> (there are 1000 of them). If you want to make T, R or I
 dependent on a CF, you should write its number (from 1 to 1000) between these numbers. <br>
 If the flag number is positive, then condition is - &quot;if flag is set&quot;, if negative, then - &quot;if flag is not set&quot;.<br>
Variables comparisons can also be used as conditions of execution. See the VR receiver section for more information on variables.

  If a command parameter is shown as $ it means that its value can be stored in a variable. If it's shown as # it means that it can only be set,
  but not read. And if it's shown as ?$ it means it can be read but not set.</font>

<b><font color="#0000FF">Example:</font></b>
  <script type="erm">!!LE10/33/1&1/-2/5:E500 O2 L0;</script>
  </strong>This is a Receiver of type LE (event on map) with coordinates X=10, Y=33, Level=Underground. Receiver Body has 3 commands:
  E, O and L (see: <a target="sommaire" href="../receivers/receiver_le.htm">LE Receiver</a>). These commands (Body) would be executed only if at
  the execution moment, the 1st and 5th of the conditional flags are set, but the 2nd is not set. Otherwise, the Body won't execute.</font>

  <p>

<font class="Helvetica32" face="Arial" size="2">
  Whenever a player activates a trigger it causes some actions on one or more receivers. A trigger can be an event, object or hero that a player's
  hero visits, or it could be an ERM function called by other ERM code or even a timer set up to trigger at a specific time or interval (e.g., 
  every 14 days). The properties of the trigger event or object do not matter for purposes of it being a trigger. The action of the trigger must
  be described in a timed event. Instructions use the basic same format as receivers, except that they start with a slightly different code.
  Unlike receivers, Instructions execute only once when the map is loaded.<br>
