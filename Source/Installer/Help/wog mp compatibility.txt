WoG MP Script Compatibility   August 25, 2004

The following combat scripts should be fully compatible with network human-to-human battles. If you encounter synchronization errors or other network-specific combat errors with these scripts enabled, please inform us with full details.

Note: non-combat scripts and combat scripts that only involve neutral units aren't listed as these will never be part of a network human-to-human battle anyway, so anything not listed in this document should be considered fully compatible.

NETWORK BATTLE COMPATIBLE SCRIPTS

script01.erm - Map Rules
script03.erm - Secondary Skills Boost
script41.erm - Battle Extender (not technically a combat script since it just changes base
               creature stats for the entire game)
script44.erm - Emerald Tower (the ability and stat changes should work in all battles)
script46.erm - Berserker Flies
script48.erm - Enhanced Secondary Skills
